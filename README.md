# Hi, I'm Krish Gudigar 👋

## AI & Machine Learning Student | Research-Oriented | Model Builder

I am a **second-year AI & Machine Learning student**, deeply obsessed with my field and committed to mastering it at a fundamental level. I focus on **building strong conceptual understanding**, experimenting with models, and steadily moving toward **research-driven work** in AI.

I believe strong engineers and researchers are built through **curiosity, consistency, and depth**, not shortcuts — and that mindset guides everything I learn and build.
